## Cloud storage options for film photographers!

Hi everyone! My name is Jenny and I'm currently a grad student studying moving image archiving and preservation at NYU.

This is my first ever blog post on GitHub and I would like to discuss Cloud storage options for film photographers!

Besides school, I love to shoot on my film camera in my free time!
I used to only shoot on my small digital camera around 4 years ago. Until one day my camera broke, that's when I found my grandfather's old Nikon FM. My grandpa told me he had no use for it so he gave it to me. 4 years later, the Nikon FM and another autofocus Pentax 120SW is all I use to shoot my photos!

If you shoot film in this day and age, ultimately you will run into the problem of "how do I store all my the digital files of my film scans"?

1. Google Photos
